Difficulty speaking out and interacting with other people, social anxiety, nervousness.
My inability to speak out has been my downfall for quite some time now. Not in the sense some people might think, like about bullying or some wrongdoing, but about just some of the most basic interactions. I like interacting with others, yet I don't. I hate driving to places I have never been by myself. I always drive with my sister or someone that knows their way around town and who won't get lost. I don't like talking to strangers whom I don't know. I don't like doing a lot of things, yet I want to do alot of things. There is this anxious feeling that comes when I am experiencing any kind of interaction. It builds up like a tight ball in my chest. It happens everytime I try to talk to someone new, try to ask a question, or presenting in front of the class. Don't get me started on presentations! I know they are not so bad but the initial fear gets to me everytime. I'm always red faced and almost hyperventilating before it even starts. Sound begins to fade and it is almost like my brain tries to tune out all the noise by. Shivers. You can feel these numb like tingles slowly moving through your arms and legs and all over your body. It almost feels like when your limbs falls asleep and feels like something small is pricking me all over and this is a strange way to describe it but it feels like static.
